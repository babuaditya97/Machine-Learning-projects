# Iris Species Classifier

Objective is to classify iris plants into three species flower species based on the given features.

# Data Set
The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:
  - Id
  - SepalLengthCm
  - SepalWidthCm
  - PetalLengthCm
  - PetalWidthCm
  - Species -> target variable

### Requirements
Run the script to install all nessasary packages
```sh
$ pip intsall -r requirements.txt
```


### Code flow

Open " iris_code_flow.ipynb "
The entire project is divided into to parts:
- Data preparation
- Model building

Detailed description along with the model bulding and analysis can be found in the notebook.

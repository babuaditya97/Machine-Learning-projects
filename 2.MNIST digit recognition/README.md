# MNIST digit recognizer

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

# Data Set
The data files data/train.csv contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine.

Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.The data files train.csv and test.csv contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine.

### Requirements
Run the script to install all nessasary packages
```sh
$ pip intsall -r requirements.txt
```


### Code flow

Open " MNIST_code_flow.ipynb "
The entire project is divided into to parts:
- Data preparation
- Model building

Detailed description along with the model bulding and analysis can be found in the notebook.
